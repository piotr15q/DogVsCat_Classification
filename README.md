# Dog vs Cat Classifier

Design of an image classifier that discriminates between dogs and cats using a convolutional neural network (CNN) implemented in PyTorch.

## 📌 Functionalities

- 🔍 Classification of images into two classes: dog or cat
- 🖼️ Loading and processing images into a format suitable for the model
- 📊 Visualization of training results (accuracy, loss)
- 💾 Save and load the trained model
- 🧪 Ability to test the model on new images
